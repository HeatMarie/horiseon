h/w 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor - Horiseon business reputation management

<img src="images/screenshot.jpg">

Why and what problem we solve. 
This is a reafactoring of existing code which the goal is to make it meet web accessibility standards which optimizes the website for search engines. 

Requirements 
Meets accessibility standards when: 
there are semantic HTML elements
The elements follow a logical structuree independent of styling and positioning
there are accessible alt attributes
Heading attributes fall in sequential order
The title element has a concise, descriptive title

What I learned. 

When first opening a file there is a complete fear of not knowing how to achieve the requirements/goals that  I am looking to accomplish. After taking a few deep breaths and a couple google searches for a refresher everything slowly came together. 

I changed the title from website to Horiseon (since that's the name of the company). I added a header tag, changed a div to main, changed some divs to sections, changed a div to aside, added a footer. 

As of right now, one thing I am not happy with is the link to the online-engine-optimization. The page does not appear to move, I would like this to move to the search optimization section. 

Condensed CSS to avoid repeats.
